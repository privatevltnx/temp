===== APP DETAIL PAGE IMPLEMENTATION =====

✅ WHAT HAS BEEN SET UP:

1. CLICKABLE APP CARDS
   - All app cards on the main page are now clickable
   - Clicking any card or the "Details" button redirects to app detail page
   - Cards have cursor pointer styling

2. URL PARAMETER PASSING
   - When you click an app, it passes the app ID via URL parameter
   - Format: app_ios.html?id=2 (for WhatsApp with id=2)
   - This allows the detail page to know which app to display

3. APP DATA ON DETAIL PAGE
   - App Icon (large display from Google Play Store)
   - App Name (full name)
   - Developer Name (with link)
   - Rating (star rating and number)

   - About Section

4. NAVIGATION
   - Back arrow button at the top to return to main page
   - Link to developer page
   - Search bar on detail page

5. COMPLETE APP DATA IN SCRIPT_NEW.JS
   Each app has all the following fields:
   - id (unique identifier)
   - name (full app name)
   - developer (developer/company name)
